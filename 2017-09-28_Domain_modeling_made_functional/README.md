# [DRAFT] Domain Modeling made Functional

This was the first time ever, I participated officialy as a book reviewer and I was really proud to find my name in the book when it was officialy published.

I would like to thank Jérémie Chassaing, Brian Mac Donald and obviously Scott Wlaschin for this wonderful experience.
